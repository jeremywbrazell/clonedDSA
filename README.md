[Shift Array](javascript/code-challenges/arrayShift/array-shift.js)

# Challenge Summary
Code challenge to insert value into middle of array.

## Challenge Description
Without using built in methods, insert a value into the middle of an array.

## Approach & Efficiency
I used splice to add to middle of array, but, first had to figure out how to create a value for the middle of it to insert into.

[Array Binary](javascript/code-challenges/arrayBinarySearch/array-binary-search.js)

# Challenge Summary
Return index of sorted array's element that is equal to search key.

## Challenge Description
Return index of sorted array's element that is equal to search key, or -1 if element doesn't exist.

## Approach & Efficiency
Used a function to declare beginning and end of sorted array (-1 if end of array because index begins at 0).  Built an if else statement that divides the array in half and creates a conditiona that says if key is greater than middle, remove what's on left so that function continues searching on right and vice versa if it's less than.

# Challenge Summary
Linked List Insertions

## Challenge Description
.append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list

## Approach & Efficiency
I used the same formula as I did for insert and wrote similar tests.

## Solution
